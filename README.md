# Vedant Raval - Interactive Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio. This is a full-stack web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a data science student. The entire site was built from the ground up with a focus on a professional user experience, advanced animations, and a clean, modern aesthetic.
